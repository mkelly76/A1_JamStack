<h1>Why We Love Jon Bon Jovi</h1>
<p>From his early years as an unbelievable ambitious teen singer prowling the clubs of Asbury Park, New Jersey, where he jammed with the likes of Bruce Springsteen while still in high school, to his ascent into global rock superstardom, Jon Bon Jovi embodies the spirit of the rock 'n' roll American Dream.</p>
<p>Jon grew up in the humble working-class suburb of Sayreville, New Jersey. He wasn't born to a rich or influential family - just one that supported the belief that anything was possible, even if things didn't always go your way.</p>
<p>Jon translated that belief into his music, which allowed him to connect with people in a sincere and honest way. Almost everyone, no matter where they are in life, has lived their own variation of Tommy and Gina's struggle in &quot;Livin' on a Prayer.&quot; That song transcended its original theme to become a message of hope - a message so strong that 10 days after the 9/11 terror attacks, Jon performed &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; on <em>America: A Tribute to Heroes</em>, a telethon that raised more than $200 million for the United Way's September 11th Fund.</p>
<p>As we've watched Jon's career unfold over the decades, we've seen him continue to evolve, mature and aim higher and higher - always trying to find the next level up for what he might be able to achieve. &quot;Anytime that you think you've reached the top of the mountain, the truth of the matter is, you've just reached another mountain.&quot; Jon said on an episode of Oprah Winfrey's <em>Master Class</em>. &quot;When I heard 'Runaway' on the radio, I thought I made it. When I got a record deal, I thought I made it. When we had <em>Slippery When Wet</em>, I thought we made it. When we played the first time at an arena and you headlined, you thought you made it. Each step along the way is just a life's lesson in humility, and it gives you ammunition to go on and be excited about the next day.&quot;</p>
<p>Jon Bon Jovi is a rarity - not only in music, but in any walk of life. He's a person who has achieved success without letting success corrupt his values or how he chooses to engage with the world. Married to his high-school sweetheart for more than three decades, committed to family and community more than he is to fame and fortune, and always striving to be the best version of himself that he can possibly be - his is a small-town-boy-makes-good story that anyone can applaud and admire.</p>
